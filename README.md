# ðŸ“š AI-Powered Learning Resource Backend

A Flask-based backend for uploading, parsing, enriching, and indexing PDFs and web links with AI summaries and semantic search, using pdfplumber, Jina Reader, OpenAI, AWS, and Algolia MCP Server.

# Features

1. User Management: Handles user registration/login and file management with AWS Cognito and S3.
2. PDF Upload & Parsing: Extracts text from uploaded PDFs using pdfplumber.
3. Web Link Content Extraction: Crawls and parses web pages/articles using Jina Reader.
4. AI Summarization: Uses OpenAI (GPT models) to generate concise summaries, key points, and practice questions (returned as JSON).
5. Semantic Search: Indexes assets and AI-enriched metadata to Algolia MCP Server for fast, smart search across all uploads.
